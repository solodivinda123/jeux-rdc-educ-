## Current Setup

Right now, the page uses placeholder images from placeholder.com. These will show automatically and look professional until you add your own images.

## Tips

- Use high-quality images (at least 320x280 pixels)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 500KB per image)
- Use consistent aspect ratios for uniform appearance
- Test your images in different browsers
